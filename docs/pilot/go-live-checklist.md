## Known Limitations to Communicate

Share these with pilot participants in welcome emails and setup instructions:

- [ ] Mobile app is **parent-only** — students and teachers use the web app
- [ ] Mobile requires **Expo Go** app (not on App Store / Google Play yet)
- [ ] **No push notifications** — open the app to check for updates (auto-refreshes every 30s)
- [ ] Account setup, child management, starting new conversations, study materials — **use the web app**

## If Something Goes Wrong

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **P1 — Service down** | Follow [Incident Response](../INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md#p1-service-down) procedures immediately |
| **P2 — Major feature broken** | Fix and push, or rollback. See [Incident Response](../INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md#p2-major-feature-broken) |
| **P3/P4 — Minor issue** | Log in GitHub Issues, fix after launch |

Hotfix procedure: [deploy-freeze.md](deploy-freeze.md#hotfix-plan)

## Post-Launch (Mar 6 Afternoon)

- [ ] Confirm all pilot participants received welcome emails
- [ ] Confirm at least one parent successfully logged in via mobile
- [ ] Review Cloud Run metrics — no elevated error rates
- [ ] Review Cloud SQL metrics — no connection issues
- [ ] Check GitHub Issues for any reported bugs
- [ ] Send "launch successful" status update to stakeholders

## Dependencies

All `#march-6-pilot` issues must be complete before launch. Verify:

```bash
gh issue list --label march-6-pilot --state open
```

If any remain open, assess whether they are blockers or can be deferred.
